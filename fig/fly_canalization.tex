  \caption{This cartoon summarizes an artificial selection experiment performed on \textit{Drosophilia melangoster}. In treatment i, selection is made for a bilaterally symmetric trait -- overall decreased eye size in this illustration. However, in treatment ii artificial selection for a non-bilaterally symmetric trait -- relatively smaller right eye size -- fails \cite{Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment}}.
