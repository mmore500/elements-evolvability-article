in a few sentences

both EA and evolutionary biology researchers are beginning to wonder if the modern synthesis is sufficient to explain the full power of evolution to innovate as has been observed in nature (and attempted to replicate as an algorithm). Studying evolvability, searching for mechanisms that promote heritable variance and a bias towards useful variance, is one way researchers are trying to address this question. Both fields will benefit from considering expansions to the evolutionary model.
